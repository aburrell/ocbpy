Grid and scale vector data
---------------------------------------------
Many space science observations, such as ion drifts, are vectors.  The
**ocbpy.ocb_scaling.VectorData**
`routine <ocb_scaling.html#module-ocbpy.ocb_scaling>`__ class 
ensures that the vector location, direction, and magnitude are gridded and
scaled appropriately.

An example will be added here.
