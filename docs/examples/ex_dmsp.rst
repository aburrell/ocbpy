DMSP SSJ Boundaries
===================

For more information about these boundaries, see Section
:ref:`bound-data-dmsp-ssj`.


Loading DMSP SSJ Boundaries
---------------------------
Unlike the IMAGE and AMPERE boundaries, the DMSP SSJ boundaries are not included
with the package.  However, routines to obtain them are.  To use them, you need
to install the
`ssj_auroral_boundary <https://github.com/lkilcommons/ssj_auroral_boundary>`__
package.  Once installed, you can download DMSP SSJ data and obtain a boundary
file for a specified time period using
:py:mod:`ocbpy.boundaries.dmsp_ssj_files`.  For this example, we'll use a
single day. You can download the files into any directory, but this example will
put them in the same directory as the other OCB files.

::
   
   import datetime as dt
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import ocbpy
   import os

   stime = dt.datetime(2010, 12, 31)
   etime = stime + dt.timedelta(days=1)
   out_dir = os.path.join(os.path.split(ocbpy.__file__)[0], "boundaries")

   bfiles = ocbpy.boundaries.dmsp_ssj_files.fetch_format_ssj_boundary_files(
       stime, etime, out_dir=out_dir, rm_temp=False)


By setting ``rm_temp=False``, all of the different DMSP files will be kept in
the specified output directory.  You should have three CDF files (the data
downloaded from each DMSP spacecraft), the CSV files (the boundaries calculated
for each DMSP spacecraft) and four boundary files.  The boundary files have
an extention of ``.eab`` for the Equatorial Auroral Boundary and ``.ocb`` for
the Open-Closed field line Boundary.  The files are separated by hemisphere, and
also specify the date range.  Because only one day was obtained, the start and
end dates in the filename are identical.  When ``rm_temp=True``, the CDF and CSV
files are removed.

You can now load the DMSP SSJ boundaries by specifying the desired filename,
instrument, and hemisphere or merely the instrument and hemisphere.


::
   
   # Load with filename, instrument, and hemisphere
   south_file = os.path.join(out_dir,
                             "dmsp-ssj_south_20101231_20101231_v1.1.2.ocb")
   ocb_south = ocbpy.OCBoundary(filename=south_file, instrument='dmsp-ssj',
                                hemisphere=-1)
   print(ocb_south)

   Uses scaling function(s):

The circular scaling function with no input adds zero the the boundaries, and
so performs no scaling.

Using DMSP SSJ Boundaries
-------------------------

Because DMSP SSJ Boundaries are only measured along a satellite track, you
cannot use these boundaries to convert between magnetic and OCB or Dual-boundary
coordinates at just any location or local time.  To address this issue, the
:py:func:`ocbpy.cycle_boundary.satellite_track` function can be used to
determine whether or not a location is close enough to the satellite track.
This example shows the width along the linear approximation of the satellite
track allowed along the Boundary latitude.  The axis formatting is performed
using the :ref:`set_up_polar_plot <format-polar-axes>` function defined in the
:ref:`exconvert` example.

::

   # Set up the figure
   fig = plt.figure()
   ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="polar"
   set_up_polar_plot(ax, hemi=ocb_south.hemisphere)

   # Get the OCB location in AACGM coordinates
   mlt = np.linspace(0, 24, 64)
   ocb_south.get_aacgm_boundary_lat(mlt)

   # Plot the OCB location
   ax.plot(mlt * np.pi / 12.0,
           90 + ocb_south.aacgm_boundary_lat[ocb_south.rec_ind], "m-", lw=2,
	   label="OCB")

   # Deterimine which OCB locations are along the satellite track
   igood = ocbpy.cycle_boundary.satellite_track(
       ocb_south.aacgm_boundary_lat[ocb_south.rec_ind],
       ocb_south.aacgm_boundary_mlt[ocb_south.rec_ind],
       ocb_south.x_1[ocb_south.rec_ind], ocb_south.y_1[ocb_south.rec_ind],
       ocb_south.x_2[ocb_south.rec_ind], ocb_south.y_2[ocb_south.rec_ind],
       hemisphere=ocb_south.hemisphere)
   ax.plot(mlt[igood] * np.pi / 12.0,
           90 + ocb_south.aacgm_boundary_lat[ocb_south.rec_ind][igood], "ks",
           label="Measured OCB")


The default constraints for :py:func:`ocbpy.cycle_boundary.satellite_track`
allow a 1 degree deviation in either Cartesian direction and a maximum distance
of 5 degrees equatorward of the Boundary.

::

   lat = np.arange(-90, -60, 1)
   grid_mlt, grid_lat = np.meshgrid(mlt, lat)
   grid_mlt = grid_mlt.flatten()
   grid_lat = grid_lat.flatten()

   igood = ocbpy.cycle_boundary.satellite_track(
       grid_lat, grid_mlt, ocb_south.x_1[ocb_south.rec_ind],
       ocb_south.y_1[ocb_south.rec_ind], ocb_south.x_2[ocb_south.rec_ind],
       ocb_south.y_2[ocb_south.rec_ind], hemisphere=ocb_south.hemisphere)
   ax.plot(grid_mlt[~igood] * np.pi / 12.0, 90 + grid_lat[~igood], ".",
           color="palegreen", label="Data", zorder=1)
   ax.plot(grid_mlt[igood] * np.pi / 12.0, 90 + grid_lat[igood], "g.",
           label="Satellite track data")
   ax.legend(loc=2, title="{:}".format(ocb_south.dtime[ocb_south.rec_ind]),
             bbox_to_anchor=(-0.4, 1.15))

Note that because the OCB is determined based off of only two points, the OCB
MLT is not very accurate.  **With poorly defined OCBs, we recommend using only
the gridded latitude along the satellite track.**
