 
File is based on SuperMAG data file, which contains N, E, Z from individual
ground magnetometer stations. The coordinate system is defined as:
N is positive in the direction of local magnetic north; E is positive in the
local magnetic east direction; and Z is positive vertical down.

Data formatting information:

The file is broken into records, one record per minute. The record
consists of a header and a body. The format for the header is:

<yr> <mo> <dy> <hr> <mt> <sc> <stnum>

Where yr,mo,dy,hr,mt and sc give the UTC timestamp for this record. The
final number stnum, gives the number of stations in the record body

The record body consists of one line per station:

<stid> <N> <E> <Z> <MLT> <MLAT> <DEC> <SZA>

Where stid is the stations IAGA code and N,E,Z represent the component of 
the magnetic field.
        
Data gap identifier is 999999.
  
SML and SMU indices are included after the date and before the stations
